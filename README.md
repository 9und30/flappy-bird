# flep bord

A bad Flappy Bird Clone made in Python with Pygame. Not the cleanest code I've written since it's my first actual selfmade Pygame game.
It was pretty fun creating.
Might add stuff from the [todo text file](https://github.com/9und30/flappy-bird/blob/main/todo.txt).

Tested and working with Python 3.9.4 and Pygame 2.0.1.

To play, run Game.py.
